  quality_assessment:
    first_attempt:
      lines_written: 313
      tests_created: 28  # (appears to run twice in output)
      tests_passing: 28
      tests_failing: 0
      test_types:
        - "Basic get/set for all types (String, Long, Int, Float, Boolean)"
        - "Delete and isSet behavior"
        - "Default value handling"
        - "Initial preferences constructor"
        - "getObject() with custom types"
        - "getAll() behavior"

  haiku_strengths:
    - "Created comprehensive test coverage on first attempt"
    - "All 28 tests passing with no fix loops"
    - "Proper test structure and assertions"
    - "Used appropriate test libraries (JUnit jupiter, kotest)"
    - "Followed existing test patterns"
    - "Clear test names and organization"

  comparison_to_r07:
    r07_complexity: "BroadcastReceiver integration tests (high complexity)"
    r07_fix_loops: 1
    r07_issue: "Incomplete test stubs for complex patterns"

    r28_complexity: "Unit tests for preference store (medium complexity)"
    r28_fix_loops: 0
    r28_success: "All tests working on first attempt"

    finding: "Haiku improved - learned from R07 experience or R28 was better suited to Haiku's strengths"

  haiku_learning_curve:
    r07_first_haiku_test: "Struggled with integration test complexity"
    r28_second_haiku_test: "Clean execution on unit test patterns"
    hypothesis: "Haiku better at unit tests than integration tests, OR gaining experience"
