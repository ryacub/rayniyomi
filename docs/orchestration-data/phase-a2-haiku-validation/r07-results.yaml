  ticket: R07
  issue: 16
  execution_model: haiku
  review_tier: T1

  outcome: PASS_WITH_FIX_LOOP

  execution:
    task_1_branch: completed_successfully
    task_2_implementation: completed_with_issues
    task_4_fixes: completed_successfully

  quality_assessment:
    first_attempt:
      lines_written: 398
      tests_created: 11
      tests_passing: 8
      tests_failing: 3
      failure_type: "Incomplete test stubs (no actual assertions)"

    after_fix:
      lines_final: 345
      tests_final: 8
      tests_passing: 8
      tests_failing: 0
      fix_approach: "Deleted 3 incomplete tests"

  haiku_strengths:
    - "Found and followed existing test patterns correctly"
    - "Created proper test structure (mocks, Given/When/Then)"
    - "Wrote 8 working tests covering normal and error paths"
    - "Successfully fixed issue when given clear instructions"
    - "Used appropriate test frameworks (mockk, JUnit)"

  haiku_weaknesses:
    - "Created test stubs without actual test logic for complex scenarios"
    - "Struggled with BroadcastReceiver integration testing (goAsync pattern)"
    - "Wrote 'reasonable-looking' code that doesn't actually test anything"
    - "Didn't verify tests worked before marking task complete"

  tokens_estimated:
    worker_spawn: 8000
    task_1_branch: 2000
    task_2_implementation: 10000
    task_4_fixes: 5000
    review_gates: 5000
    overhead: 5000
    total: 35000  # vs 56000 for Sonnet
    savings: 21000  # 38% reduction

  verdict:
    quality: ACCEPTABLE_WITH_FIX_LOOP
    cost: EXCELLENT_SAVINGS
    recommendation: "Haiku viable for T1 mechanical tasks IF review gates catch issues"

  lessons:
    - "Haiku CAN write tests but quality varies"
    - "1 fix loop acceptable (vs 0 for Sonnet)"
    - "T1 checklist review caught issues effectively"
    - "Cost savings (38%) worth the fix loop overhead"
    - "Haiku needs clear, explicit instructions"
