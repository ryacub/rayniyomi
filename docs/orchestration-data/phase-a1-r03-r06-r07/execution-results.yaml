    break_even_analysis: "Phase A1 at 3 tickets costs 120k vs 90k single-agent = 33% overhead. Need 4-5 tickets to break even with single-agent."

  key_learnings:
    positive:
      - "✅ Worker polling loop works perfectly"
      - "✅ Task-based coordination is reliable"
      - "✅ T1 checklist review is effective (no debate needed)"
      - "✅ Sequential execution prevents conflicts"
      - "✅ Review gates catch issues before merge"
      - "✅ Sonnet execution quality is high (0 fix loops needed)"

    negative:
      - "❌ Orchestration overhead (30k) too high for 3 simple tickets"
      - "❌ Single-agent would be 33% cheaper for this workload"
      - "❌ Break-even point is actually 4-5 tickets, not 3"

    optimization_opportunities:
      - "Use Haiku for execution (save 4k per ticket)"
      - "Batch 5+ tickets to amortize planning overhead"
      - "Skip T1 debate entirely (already doing this)"
      - "Reduce lead monitoring overhead (10k is high)"

  recommendations:
    phase_a2:
      approach: "Test with 5 tickets minimum"
      execution_model: "Haiku for T1, Sonnet for T2"
      expected_tokens: ~150k for 5 tickets (~30k per ticket)
      expected_savings_vs_single_agent: "Break even or slightly better"

    production:
      minimum_tickets: 5
      optimal_batch_size: "8-10 tickets"
      model_strategy: "Adaptive (Haiku for mechanical, Sonnet for nuanced)"

  next_steps:
    - "Document Phase A1 findings"
    - "Design Phase A2 with 5-ticket batch"
    - "Test Haiku execution in Phase A2"
    - "Validate true break-even point"
