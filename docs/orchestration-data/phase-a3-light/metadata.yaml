goal: "Validate Haiku at production scale with diverse T1 tasks"

strategy:
  total_tickets: 8
  bring_total_to: 12 (4 from A2 + 8 new)
  execution_model: haiku (all T1)
  review_tier: t1_checklist

ticket_selection_criteria:
  - T1 mechanical tasks only
  - 0.5-1 day estimates
  - Diverse task types (migrations, tests, lint, docs, refactors)
  - Independent (no blocking dependencies)
