    total: 157000

  baseline_comparison:
    estimated_phase_a1: 86000 (43k per ticket)
    actual_phase_a1: 157000 (78.5k per ticket)
    variance: +83%
    primary_driver: "T2 debate review (44k) much higher than estimated (15k)"

  vs_single_agent:
    single_agent_cost: 60000 (30k per ticket × 2)
    orchestration_cost: 157000
    overhead: 162%
    verdict: "Orchestration MORE expensive than single-agent at 2-ticket scale"

  key_learnings:
    framework_mechanics:
      - ✅ Worker autonomy works (polling loop, task claiming)
      - ✅ Task coordination works (blocking, dependencies)
      - ✅ Review gates work (caught critical issues)
      - ✅ Fix loops work (automated rework cycle)

    cost_model_updates:
      - T1 checklist: 5k (accurate)
      - T2 simple review: 15k (estimated, not tested)
      - T2 debate: 44k (ACTUAL - much higher than estimated)
      - Fix loop: 10k + re-review cost
      - Overhead per ticket: 15-20k at 2-ticket scale

    review_tier_validation:
      - T1 (R03): Checklist worked perfectly, 5k cost, no issues found
      - T2 (R06): Debate found 6 issues (4 critical), 44k cost, prevented bugs
      - Verdict: Review tiers correctly matched to complexity

    break_even_analysis:
      actual_data:
        - 2 tickets: 157k orchestration vs 60k single-agent = 162% overhead
        - Fixed overhead: ~40k (planning, spawning, monitoring)
        - Variable cost: ~60k per ticket (implementation + review + fixes)

      projected_break_even:
        - 3 tickets: ~220k orchestration vs 90k single-agent = 144% overhead
        - 5 tickets: ~340k orchestration vs 150k single-agent = 127% overhead
        - 8 tickets: ~520k orchestration vs 240k single-agent = 117% overhead
        - 10 tickets: ~640k orchestration vs 300k single-agent = 113% overhead

      conclusion: "Orchestration never breaks even economically at current costs"

  critical_insight:
    finding: "Conservative Phase A1 proves orchestration mechanics work BUT costs are too high"

    why_costs_high:
      - T2 debate (44k) is 3x more expensive than estimated (15k)
      - Fixed overhead (40k) is high at small batch sizes
      - Review + fix loops add 50%+ to implementation costs
      - Worker spawn (15k Sonnet) is expensive

    path_forward:
      phase_a2_goal: "Test if Haiku execution brings costs down to competitive levels"
      target_improvement: "Reduce per-ticket cost from 78.5k to ~40k"
      how:
        - Haiku execution: 8k vs 15k worker spawn (save 7k)
        - Haiku execution: 8k vs 12k implementation (save 4k)
        - Total savings: ~11k per ticket
        - New projected cost: 67k per ticket (still high but closer)

      ultimate_solution: "Batch size - need 8+ tickets to amortize fixed costs"

  recommendations:
    immediate:
      - ✅ Phase A1 COMPLETE - mechanics validated
      - ⏭️ Proceed to Phase A2 - test Haiku execution
      - 📊 Update cost models with actual debate costs
      - 🎯 Target 5+ tickets minimum for Phase A2

    phase_a2_design:
      - Test Haiku for T1 mechanical tickets (expected: 28k vs 56k)
      - Test Sonnet for T2 complex tickets (keep at 101k)
      - Measure: Success rate, fix loop frequency, quality
      - Decision: Adopt Haiku if success rate > 70%

    long_term:
      - Orchestration makes sense at 8+ ticket batches
      - For 1-3 tickets: Single-agent is cheaper and simpler
      - For 4-7 tickets: Marginal either way
      - For 8+ tickets: Orchestration wins on coordination value (not just cost)

  success_criteria_evaluation:
    mechanics: ✅ PASS (framework works as designed)
    quality: ✅ PASS (review gates caught critical issues)
    efficiency: ❌ FAIL (157k vs 86k target, 83% over budget)
    verdict: "Successful validation of mechanics, but cost optimization needed"

  phase_a1_verdict: VALIDATED_BUT_EXPENSIVE

  next_phase: phase_a2_haiku_validation
  next_phase_goal: "Prove Haiku can maintain quality while reducing costs"
  next_phase_tickets: 5
  next_phase_target: "200k for 5 tickets (40k per ticket) vs 250k single-agent"

  data_quality: HIGH
  confidence: HIGH
  ready_for_phase_a2: YES
