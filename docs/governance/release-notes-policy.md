# Release Notes Policy

## Requirement
Any PR labeled `user-facing` must include a concrete `Release Notes` section in the PR description.

## Good Release Note
- States user-visible behavior change.
- Mentions migration or settings impact.
- Avoids internal-only implementation details.

## Non-User-Facing Changes
If not user-facing, explicitly state why in `Release Notes` section.
