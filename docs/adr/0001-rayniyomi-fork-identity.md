# ADR 0001: Fork Identity and Naming (rayniyomi)

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-06
- Decision owners: @rayyacub

## Context
The fork must avoid user confusion, installation conflicts, and upstream service coupling.

## Decision
Adopt `rayniyomi` as the canonical fork identity for app naming, iconography, and contributor-facing docs.

## Consequences
- Positive outcomes:
  - Clear differentiation from upstream app.
  - Reduced confusion in support and issue triage.
- Tradeoffs:
  - Migration effort across docs, assets, and release naming.
  - Need for explicit compatibility notes for legacy references.

## Alternatives Considered
- Keep upstream naming with minimal suffix changes.
- Use a temporary codename and rename later.
