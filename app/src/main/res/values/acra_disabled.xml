  R38: Fork compliance - ACRA crash reporting explicitly disabled.

  This file serves as documentation that ACRA crash reporting is intentionally
  disabled in this fork to prevent data pollution of upstream services.

  This fork does NOT use ACRA crash reporting. The ACRA integration was never
  enabled and remains commented out in app/build.gradle.kts.

  See: docs/adr/0002-fork-isolation-updates-and-telemetry.md
